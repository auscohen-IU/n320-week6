# My Node.js Web Server

---
## Goal

This project demonstrates a simple Node.js HTTP server that serves **two web pages, handles navigation**, and *serves static* files.

## Final Thoughts

- I wasn't entirely sure how to get the pdf to come through aside from just putting it in the HTML file. I assumed this was not the intended way, but it was the way that ultimately ended up working. 
- I spent a little bit of time trying to figure out why I wasn't able to host a server. It wasn't until I looked at the plugins I had for Obsidian that I saw that one of them was taking up that space. 
    - In the future, I'll look into all the different ports I can use and take notes.
